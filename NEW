-a (at) is replaced by script: atcron
guarantee of seekability on pipes is replaced by command: pipe
guarantee of not executing command unless/until transfer successful is
removed.  SIGPIPE is given on error instead.  Can use command: pipe instead
-S (mail) is replaced by generic pipe: -R <pipe>
-R/-Q/-T/-r/-C (timeout) replaced by generic timeout: -T <type><val>...

Custom reports (see man page): -R/-r options

There are more %-switches for pipes; see man page.  Most importantly,
%[<cond>?<yes>:<no>] - if <cond> then add <yes>, else <no>.  Actually, the
parsing of this is nonrecursive, so ?<yes>:<no>:<yes>:<no>... works.

You can now read source/destination directories in any of 6 possible ways,
and retrieve/store files in any of 3 possible ways.

Directory read method is set by old options and/or new -o/-O options.
Note: directories in 'd' and 'f' options are cumulative & may be added to
for the source dir by simply listing more.  If multiple directories are
listed for src, all are read & combined.  If multiple dirs are in dest, only
the last dir is read and updated, and soft links are resolved to alternate
directories.  In this mode, new files which match ones already in other
directories are updated as a soft link into the old file.

"source" dir:
<ftp_addr> <dirs> -> FTP site <ftp_addr>, containing given <dirs>.
-L <name> -> Retrieve ls-lR file from already-specified FTP site
-f <name> -> Retrieve marker file, with root specified by given dirs.
-O<type>:<parm>: generic specifier

"dest" dir:
If placeholder is ever specified for "dest", then it is updated.

default -> placeholder file
-d <ldir> -> default = local directory
-t <site> -> default = remote FTP dir
-L <site> -> remote FTP ls-lR file
-l <name> -> local placeholder file
-o<type>:<parm>: generic specifier; see above.

"dest" file:
default -> no mirroring is done unless a dest is specified
-d <dir> -> files local dir
-e <cmd> -> send to command; compatible w/ -d
-t <site> -> put on FTP site

"source" file:
default -> retrieve from given FTP site/dir
-c -> ignore site & get files from local dir
-g <cmd> -> "retrieve" file by running pipe

Valid transfer methods:
pipe->pipe
pipe->ftp
pipe->local
local->ftp
local->local
local->pipe
ftp->local  - implemented & tested w/ -d option
ftp->pipe   - implemented & tested w/ -e option
ftp->ftp  -> This is a special mode, and requires PASV support on at least one
             of the two sites.
