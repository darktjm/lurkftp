lurkftp v1.00

What it is: This is the ultimate FTP site lurker program.  It is a simple
program to monitor changes in FTP sites and either just report changes or
mirror changes into a local directory.

So why another mirror program?  Because I couldn't get any of the mirror
programs on sunsite to do what I wanted half-way reliably & efficiently.

Read the man page for more details.

As far as I know, Alex deVries <adevries@engsoc.carleton.ca> has created an
RPM package for this (and uploaded it to ftp.redhat.com), and Christian
Schwarz <schwarz@monet.m.isar.de> has created a Debian package for this.
Thanks guys.  I do not (and probably will not) maintain anything other than
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/file-transfer/lurkftp*.tar.gz,
although I might change my mind and add distribution generation to a Makefile
instead of doing it manually.  If I ever decide to "upgrade" my system
(which will take forever, since I never log any of the plentiful changes I
make to the system), I'll make sure I put a recent rpm/dpkg on my system so
I can maintain these, too.

Installation notes:

Based on bug reports by people who tried to run this on non-Linux systems,
this bugger should compile on just about any POSIX-compliant system.  If it
doesn't, then feel free to send me a compiler error dump or whatever.  The
only non-Linux system(s) I have access to for free are some Sun workstations
(Solaris 2.5).  I can probably  look up information on AIX 4.2/3.2.5 machines
and DEC Ultrix machines, too, although I can't compile on them.  I guess I
could also try getting it to work under AIX 2.1, but I'd rather not bother.

SOCKS support isn't something I use, so you'll have to fix it yourself if
it's broken.  Instead of using the big, nasty collection of -D's, I put
those defines into ftp.h and modified ftp.c appropriately.  You'll have to
modify the Makefile to include the -lsocks and the -DSOCKS, as shown
therein.

KNOWN BUGS

[+: may want to fix; *: definitely want to fix; -: may never fix]

* Doesn't handle non-UNIX remote sites [I know of none any more]
* Probably plenty of nasty hidden bugs
+ Some fixed-sized buffers may overflow
+ Few options are really range-checked
+ Can't mirror a single file
- Groups & user names aren't mirrored
- Sockets aren't mirrored
- Exact time isn't used for comparison (only accurate to what ls gives)

Ok, to give some credit here:

I finally took a detailed look at mirror.pl's documentation, and decided to
add the following to lurkftp (although I haven't yet):
- "ignore" filter
- option to ignore dates &/or ignore size &/or look for "newer" files
- option for "skip mirror if too many changes"
- option for "Force transfer of everything"
- new list parsing routines (VMS/DOS/Mac) from lsparse.pl
